# Power and design tools for Scottish Digital-Aerial bird surveys

This repository contains code supporting the work described in Donovan & Caneco (2020)<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. This was a body of work commissioned by Marine Scotland to look at designs for digital aerial surveying of bird populations in 4 different sized regions on the East Coast of Scotland. The surveys are intended for two purposes:

* monitoring of population changes
* estimation of Flight Height Distributions (FHD) with LiDAR

Seven bird species and harbour porpoise were considered - full details can be found in the indicated report.

## Repository structure

There are two sets of code expected to be of broad utility, one calculating power from variable survey effort, the other providing survey polygons for FHD estimation. These are within the folders _Survey power_ and _FHD_ respectively within the code folder.

Code underpinning the analyses presented within Donovan & Caneco (2020) are provided within the folder _Marine Scotland Analyses_, noting not all data used are included in the repository, only that which is sufficiently small and where able to be freely distributed. Specific data providers would need to be approached to fully replicate results.
