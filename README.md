# Power and design tools for Scottish Digital-Aerial bird surveys

This repository contains code supporting the work described in Donovan & Caneco (2020)[^1]. This was a body of work commissioned by Marine Scotland to look at designs for digital aerial surveying of bird populations in 4 different sized regions on the East Coast of Scotland. The surveys are intended for two purposes:

* monitoring of population changes
* estimation of Flight Height Distributions (FHD) with LiDAR

Seven bird species and harbour porpoise were considered - full details can be found in the indicated report.

## Repository structure

There are two sets of code presented, one calculating power from variable survey effort, the other providing survey polygons for FHD estimation. These are within the folders _Survey power_ and _FHD_ respectively.
